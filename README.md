# ScNetwork

## The demo
https://dimashin.github.io/dimashin-github.com/
Unfortunately github pages is not supporting fallback 404 to index.html. That's why reloading the page on any url except original one won't work.
I found some workarounds for this, like https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages or I can choose different hosting (heroku for example).
But I don't think you will appreciate this as much as I spend time on it
 
## Few words about this task

First of all I have to say, that this task wasn't so easy for me, 'cos my experience with angular was in the past and things have changed a bit since then.
Anyway I'm proud with what I've did, but have some workarounds in the code.
The biggest problem for me - was testing. You wont find much tests in this project. Especially with rxjs marbles testing. I spent couple hours to find out how it works, but at the end still got different snapshots.
Also there are some comments in the code, that describe my opinion about solution or the reasons, why I choose it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
